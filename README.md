# CS-230

#The Gaming Room is a client that hired us to help them integrate their picture based game, Draw It or Lose It, across multiple platforms.
#I did well with the coding aspect of this game, as well as with the models and analysis of the pros and cons of using Linux, Apple OS, and Microsoft.
#The design document helped when determining how the code needed to work and interact to achieve the desired outcome.
#If I could choose one part to revise, I would probably revise my work on the pro's/con's of using Linux since I am not as familiar with that OS.
#In order to interpret the user's needs, I had to understand how they wanted their game to work, and to use and add to the existing diagram.
#It is important to consider the users needs when designing, so that you can ensure you are meeting their requirements.
#My approach to designing software was to understand what the user's needs were, develop a strategy to ensure those needs were met, and to analyze all aspects of which OS should be used. 
#I would use the same approach that I used for this project in future projects. It seemed to work very well and ensured that I met the user's needs.
